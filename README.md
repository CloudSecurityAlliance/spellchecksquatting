# Spell Check Squatting

Mobile platforms often enable spellcheck by default which can result in user entered data being modified unexpectedly if the user is not paying attention sufficiently.

# Solutions:

## For web sites

Label text fields as `autocorrect="off"` and `"spellcheck="false"` in order to disable this.

## For iOS users

1. Open the Settings app
2. Tap General
3. Tap Keyboard
4. Tap the Auto-Correction toggle switch to turn it on or off
